Question maybe premium
First decide time and space complexity by seeing constraints (see interview tips) then 
code yourself judge time and space complexity  and try to improve as per follow up then see 
better solution in discussion or solutions(maybe premium), other video or article
code after knowing the algo and then
write all approaches snippet with time and space in note 

you can write custom test cases instead of default test case
for numbers directly input
for string input use ""..."" e.g ""abc""
